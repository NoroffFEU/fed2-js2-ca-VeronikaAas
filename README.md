JavaScript 2 CA Noroff <br>
This will end up being a pretty and functionable social media app. <br>

So far in the project, I have worked with functions in JavaScript. I have completed the tasks required for this CA. <br>
The elements present on the page are:
<ul>
<li>Registering a new user</li>
<li>Logging in with an existing user</li>
<li>Logging out a user, where the token is removed from Local Storage</li>
<li>Creating a new post</li>
<li>Editing a post</li>
<li>Deleting a post</li>
<li>A page where 12 posts are visible at once, and it is updated as soon as a new post is created</li>
<li>A page where you can open a single post by clicking on the post you want to view in the feed</li>
</ul>
I have used the API provided by Noroff, which allows for user authentication and post management.<br>

The site is built with:
<li>HTML</li>
<li>Next to nothing CSS</li>
<li>Vite</li>
<li>API for Back-End Operations</li><br>
